# Aadhar_Card_OCR_Python
This is a simple implementation of a OCR reader for the Aadhar and PAN Card. To use this project: 
- Download the python files in the repository.
- Open the python files - **Aadhar_OCR.py** and **PAN_OCR.py** in any IDLE and make the necessary changes in the code to match your system.
- Make sure that the mysql server is running while running the main source file **FYP_OCR.py**. Create a table in a database with columns for Aadhar card number, gender, data of birth, and name for reading the Aadhar Card details. Also create a table in a database with column for PAN card no. for reading the PAN card details.
- Execute the python file - **FYP_OCR.py** and make sure the files **Aadhar_OCR.py** and **PAN_OCR.py** are in the same working directory.

## Implementation Steps
1 .Execute the **FYP_OCR.py** file you should observe this window  <br>

2 .Select **Aadhar Card** or **PAN Card** you should be promted to a new open-file window  <br>

3 .On uploading an image, you might have to wait for a few seconds (depending on your system) and you see your details extracted from the image. <br>

4 .If the details extracted are not correct the user may rectify that in the text box. Once the details are verified the user may click the submit button and expect the following response - <br>

On pressing **3** and **Enter** the window closes and the details will be reflected in the mysql database.
